I write about cloud, business intelligence & Python. 

I am currently working as a business intelligence analyst with a focus on financial reporting, data governance & infrastructure. I have a background in financial analysis and consulting, with focuses on process automation, financial modeling, and infrastucture optimization. This experience has largely been through the lens of data engineering and business process improvements. I have extensive experience in working with both technical and operational teams in a cross functional capacity to implement highly technical solutions to solve business cases. 

When I am not working, I enjoy spending time outdoors, playing with my son, and trying new restaurants and breweries with my partner in the Kansas City Area.
