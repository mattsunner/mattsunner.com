      <description>Calculating Pi is possible by using the probability of co-prime values in a large set of random numbers. This was inspired by Matt Parkerâ€™s YouTube video, Generating Pi From 1,000 Random Numbers, posted in 2017. This video is excellent at explaining the maths logic behind the formula, so I won&amp;rsquo;t cover it here. The repository discussed here uses the same methodology as Matt Parker used, but on a much larger scale.</description>
